# Security dashboard

## Question
How can you represent measures of cyber security visually? (And what security stuff can you meaningfully measure and collect anyway?)

## Background
Dashboards are a popular way of displaying a lot of information in a restricted space. Information security requires many measures to be managed and which may need acting on to improve the security status.

## Description
Design and demonstrate a dashboard which represents the cyber security status of the system of your choice.

## Deliverables to include
* Set of measures for cyber security.
* A security dashboard.
* A full explanation of what the metrics mean.
* A demonstration of how the dashboard flags up the status of your tested system as secure.
